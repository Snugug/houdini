CSS Houdini
=================

## https://houdini.glitch.me

An interactive introduction to CSS Houdini! Learn, play, and [remix](https://glitch.com/about) to your heart's content!

### Viewing This Introduction

Because Houdini is still an in-flux set of web specs, and because there is only really one implementation available in the wild today, you'll need [Chrome Canary](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/canary.html) with **Experimental Web Platform Features** turned on (`chrome://flags/#enable-experimental-web-platform-features`) in order to use most of these demos.

### Contributing & Discussing

While the code powering this site is available for remixing from Glitch, if you'd like to contribute to the main project directly (fix something, add something, etcâ€¦), head on over to the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/snugug/houdini) that powers the site. The only special thing that's happening in the codebase is shared CSS gets compiled from Sass in the `src` folder; other than that what you see is what you get. The issue queue is a good place to ask questions as well, if you'd like.

### Other Thoughts

I did a lot of SVG work for Paint API stuff in Illustrator, and getting that stuff in to a 2D drawing context would have been a pain by hand. Fortunately, the [AI to Canvas](http://blog.mikeswanson.com/ai2canvas) Illustrator plugin works wonders for that. Thanks [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) for pointing me in the right direction there.
